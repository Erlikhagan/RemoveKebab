  <h1> The Kebab Removers </h1>
  <p> Do you have kebab problems? Are the kebabs spreading too fast? Call the Kebab Removers Today!
  </p>
  <h3> We do great services such as:<h3>
    <div class=list>
    <ul>
      <li> Kebab Removal</li>
      <li> Kebab Inspection</li>
      <li> Kebab-Proofing</li>
      <li> Getting Drunk on Vodka on your Front Lawn</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <p> We also have a new revolutionary service: Kebab-Away! Kebab-Away is a intricate system of charms, talismans, and vodka designed to keep Kebab away! Don't take it from us, take it from these happy Serbs!</p>
    
      <p>"I mean, I did turn my house into a Church, but I'm Serbian so that's just fine!"-Novislav, 23</p>
      <p>"Ever since I used Kebab-Away, I've never seen a single kebab on my property. Sadly, all my vodka is gone, but oh well, at least no more Bosnians!"-Dragan, 44</p>
      <p>"Not only does it keep those filthy Turks away, but it also works on Croats and gypsies too! Who'd have guessed it works on anyone who isn't Orthodox! But, alas, all my vodka is gone too."-Arkan, 37</p>
      <p>"Kebab-Away saved me lots of time! Instead of safeguarding my property from Kebab, I can now get shitfaced after chugging a barrel of vodka and cursing the West."-Dmitar, 52</li>
      <p>"Finally I can pray to Saint Lazar in peace! No more Turks trying to denigrate my local church! Kebab-Away is a great, effective, affordable way to fix you kebab problems. Å½ivjela Srbija!"-Radovan, 18
      <p> For 3 easy payments of 999 dinars, you can rid yourself of kebabs today! To add Kebab-Away, pay a little extra in vodka. BUT, if you yell at us in a drunken stupor in the next 10 minutes, you can get Kebab-Away for free!</p>
      <h6> *We are not responsible for any damage done to you or your property by us or Kebabs. Additional kebab removals will cost more. Prices may change for no good reason. Do expect your vodka to rapidly disappear. Crosses not included, then again only a Serb would buy this, so you already have 15 or more. Deus vults sold seperately
